Ethical Issues

1. Identify any ethical concerns related to your software.
 The main ethical concerns are about user privacy, data safety, and fair use. Since our app tracks fitness and hydration data, we must make sure users understand what information we collect and how it’s used. We also have to make sure no one can use the app to harm or mislead others.

2. Does your software meet users' privacy expectations?
 Yes. Our app only collects the information needed to make the features work  like username, workouts, and hydration logs. We clearly tell users what data is collected and how it’s stored. All private data is encrypted and can be deleted anytime the user wants. We do not sell or share data with anyone outside the app.

3. Could your software result in discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or other factors? How does your software address these concerns?
 No. The app doesn’t use or ask for any personal traits like race, gender, religion, or income. Everyone is treated equally. Achievements and rewards are based only on workouts and progress not personal details. This ensures the app is fair to all users.

4. Can your software be misused by some users to harm others or the public? How do you prevent this?
 We designed the app to prevent harm.

There’s no public chat or comment feature, so users can’t harass or bully others.
All user activity is personal — only the user can see their data.
If we add social features later, we’ll include report, block, and content filters.
We don’t allow cheating tools or false workout entries to keep the system fair.
