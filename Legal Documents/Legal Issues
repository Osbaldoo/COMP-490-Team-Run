Legal Issues

1. Identify any legal concerns related to your software.
 The main legal concerns are following software licenses, intellectual property rights, and preventing illegal user behavior. We make sure all third-party software and media are properly licensed.

2. Is your software complying with all licensing agreements? List all third-party software you plan to use and ensure you have the right to use them as intended.
  Yes. We follow all license rules for every tool we use.
  Here are the main ones:

React Native / Expo – for building the app (MIT License)
Spring Boot – for backend services (MIT License)
PostgreSQL– for database and user authentication (Google License)
Google Fit API / Apple HealthKit – for tracking workouts (requires user permission)
Lottie animations / open-source icons – only using free and open licensed media

3. Are there any intellectual property constraints from your client or the owner of some dataset you need to use? List them.
 No. We don’t use any private or copyrighted datasets. All data comes from the user or approved APIs like Google Fit and HealthKit. Any art, icons, or sounds used in the app will be ope source or original.

4. Can your users use your app to break the law, post copyrighted works on your web app, or steal information?
 No. The app doesn’t allow uploads or file sharing. Users can only log workouts and hydration. Our terms of service will clearly say that illegal activities like hacking, stealing data, or cheating are not allowed. Accounts involved in that will be banned.
