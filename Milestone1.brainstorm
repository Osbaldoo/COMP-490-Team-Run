4- Project Idea:
Workout RPG App Brief Proposal:
We came up with a project idea of a Workout RPG app. The app will
track your workouts, but it will also have an RPG character in the app
that will mimic you. The character will grow stronger as you log your
workout. For example, if you do pushups and record them in the app
your RPG character will grow with you. We also want to add a water
intake feature. For example it will probably give you a boost or extra
health for every time you drink water. Platform: React native IDE: VScode Backend: Java (SprintBoot) Database: postgresql Libraries: react-native-maps APIs you will access: Google Maps API Package manager: Gradle
