Security Issues

1. Identify any security concerns related to your software:
 Our main security concerns are data leaks, stolen passwords, and fake accounts. Since users log personal health progress, we must keep that private and secure.

2. Identify sensitive information stored by your software and explain how you plan to protect it:
 Sensitive data includes:

User login (email and password)
Fitness and hydration logs
Optional connected data from Google Fit or HealthKit

We protect this data by:

Encrypting passwords (using hashing)
Using secure HTTPS for all connections
Limiting who can access the database (only the app server)
Allowing users to delete their data anytime
Keeping API keys and secrets hidden in private environment files, not in the code

3. Identify possible attack vectors — ways malicious users could try to exploit your software — and explain your protection plan:


Possible Attack                         Description                                 Protection Plan

Brute Force Login                       Hacker tries many passwords                 Lockout after several failed attempts

SQL Injection                           Hacker tries to inject commands             Use parameterized queries

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)              Hacker tries to run scripts in inputs       Clean and validate all user input

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)       Hacker tricks users into fake requests      Use CSRF tokens and session checks

Data Theft                              Hacker gets into database                   Encrypt sensitive data and limit access

Fake Data Submission                    User tries to send false data               Server verifies each request and user token


We also plan to test our system for vulnerabilities and update dependencies often to stay protected.
